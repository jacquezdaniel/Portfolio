      <p>My name is Daniel Jacquez. I am 28 years old. After about a decade of not being in a school environment my wife essentially made me go back to school. I have always loved technology growing up. Although coding is entirely new to me I have started to understand it a bit more. Writing a web page reminds me of when I first learned to DJ.</p>

      <p>Many DJ's these days learn to dj with a computer in front of their face and not actually being about to match the beat by ear. Once I learned to DJ without a laptop my skill level increased dramatically. I believe it is the same with coding with using plain html and css.</p>

      <p>You are able to learn the backbone and be more creative without having something essentially making your decisions follow a certain path such as with bootstrap.</p>
